# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.2.4] - 2017-04-20

### Fixed

- MEMORY SAFETY. `interrupt::free` leaked the critical section making it
  possible to access a `Mutex` when interrupts are enabled (see below). This has
  been fixed by changing the signature of `interrupt::free`.

``` rust
static FOO: Mutex<bool> = Mutex::new(false);

fn main() {
    let cs = cortex_m::interrupt::free(|cs| cs);
    // interrupts are enabled at this point
    let foo = FOO.borrow(&cs);
}
```

## [v0.2.3] - 2017-04-11 - YANKED

### Fixed

- MEMORY SAFETY. Some concurrency models that use "partial" critical sections
  (cf. BASEPRI) can be broken by changing the priority of interrupts or by
  changing BASEPRI in some scenarios. For this reason `NVIC.set_priority` and
  `register::basepri::write` are now `unsafe`.

## [v0.2.2] - 2017-04-08 - YANKED

### Fixed

- MEMORY SAFETY BUG. The `Mutex.borrow_mut` method has been removed as it can be
  used to bypass Rust's borrow checker and get, for example, two mutable
  references to the same data.

``` rust
static FOO: Mutex<bool> = Mutex::new(false);

fn main() {
    cortex_m::interrupt::free(|mut cs1| {
        cortex_m::interrupt::free(|mut cs2| {
            let foo: &mut bool = FOO.borrow_mut(&mut cs1);
            let and_foo: &mut bool = FOO.borrow_mut(&mut cs2);
        });
    });
}
```

## [v0.2.1] - 2017-03-12 - YANKED

### Changed

- The default exception handler now identifies the exception that's being
  serviced.

## [v0.2.0] - 2017-03-11 - YANKED

### Added

- Semihosting functionality in the `semihosting` module.

- `exception::Handlers` struct that represent the section of the vector table
  that contains the exception handlers.

- A default exception handler

- A high level API for the NVIC peripheral.

- Context local data.

- `borrow`/`borrow_mut` methods to `Mutex` that replace `lock`.

- API and macros to send bytes / (formatted) strings through ITM

### Changed

- [breaking-change] `StackFrame` has been renamed to `StackedRegisters` and
  moved into the `exceptions` module.

- [breaking-change] Core peripherals can now be modified via a `&-` reference
  and are no longer `Sync`.

- [breaking-change] `interrupt::free`'s closure now includes a critical section
  token, `CriticalSection`.

- [breaking-change] the core register API has been revamped for type safety.

- The safety of assembly wrappers like `wfi` and `interrupt::free` has been
  reviewed. In many cases, the functions are no longer unsafe.

- [breaking-change] `bkpt!` has been turned into a function. It no longer
  accepts an immediate value.

### Removed

- `vector_table` and its associated `struct`, `VectorTable`. It's not a good
  idea to give people a simple way to call the exception handlers.

- `Mutex`'s `lock` method as it's unsound. You could use it to get multiple
  `&mut -` references to the wrapped data.

## [v0.1.6] - 2017-01-22

### Added

- `Exception` a enumeration of the kind of exceptions the processor can service.
  There's also a `Exception::current` constructor that returns the `Exception`
  that's currently being serviced.

## [v0.1.5]

### Added

- `interrupt::Mutex`, a "mutex" based on critical sections.

### Changed

- The closure that `interrupt::free` takes can now return a value.

## [v0.1.4]

### Added

- `asm::nop`, a wrapper over the NOP instruction

## [v0.1.3]

### Added

- a StackFrame data structure

## [v0.1.2] - 2016-10-04

### Fixed

- Read/write Operations on registers (lr, cr, msp, etc.) which were reversed.

## [v0.1.1] - 2016-10-03 [YANKED]

### Changed

- Small, non user visible change to make this crate compile further for $HOST (e.g. x86_64) with the
  goal of making it possible to test, on the HOST, downstream crates that depend on this one.

## v0.1.0 - 2016-09-27 [YANKED]

### Added

- Functions to access core peripherals like NVIC, SCB and SysTick.
- Functions to access core registers like CONTROL, MSP and PSR.
- Functions to enable/disable interrupts
- Functions to get the vector table
- Wrappers over miscellaneous instructions like `bkpt`
